# Practice 8

<span style="color:red">Deadline: Check onsite on or before week 12 lab.</span>

In this practice, we'll modify Teedy's tests in order to improve its test coverage.

## Preparation

First, you should follow the tutorial so that:

* You could execute the original tests included in Teedy
* You could use JaCoCo on Teedy to generate test coverage report.

## Task

The JaCoCo report shows that the current test suite for Teedy has low instruction coverage and branch coverage.

You should add one or more test cases in order to improve both these two coverages.

A crucial part of this task is to understand Teedy's source code and test code. You could pick any element (e.g., class, method) within any module in Teedy as the target to be tested by your test cases.

## Evaluation

To demonstrate that you've completed the task, you should show us:

* The original JaCoCo test coverage report.
* The test cases that you've added
* Execute the new test cases (`mvn -Dtest=YourNewTestClass test`)
* Run `jacoco:report` again and show us the new JaCoCo test coverage report, which should have increased instruction coverage and branch coverage compared to the original report.

# [CS304] Tutorial 8: Testing with JUnit and JaCoCo

In this tutorial, we'll learn about the basics of JUnit testing. We'll also use `Teedy` to demonstrate common testing practices using `maven`, `JUnit`, and test coverage tools.

## Getting Started with JUnit

JUnit is essentially a dependency to your project, which could be downloaded and managed using Maven. You may refer to this official guide of IntelliJ IDEA to create a Maven project and add JUnit dependency in `pom.xml`.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
        <version>5.7.1</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Follow this official guide to create application code, generate tests, and execute the tests to observe the results.

## Examining Tests in Teedy

Teedy has 3 modules `docs-core`, `docs-web-common`, and `docs-web`, each can be built and tested independently. You may observe the JUnit dependency in `pom.xml` of any module, and observe the test cases written for any of the modules.

## Running Teedy Tests

The `Surefire` Plugin is used during the `test` phase of the build lifecycle to execute the unit tests of an application. In previous labs, we skipped tests when building Teedy using `mvn clean -DskipTests install`. You could simply remove the `-DskipTests` option if you want to run tests in building.

Alternatively, you could run `mvn test` directly to execute all unit tests in the project. By default, it automatically executes all test classes with the following wildcard patterns:

* `**/Test*.java`
* `**/*Test.java`
* `**/*Tests.java`
* `**/*TestCase.java`

If the test classes do not follow the default wildcard patterns, then override them by configuring the Surefire Plugin and specify the tests you want to include (or exclude) or another patterns.

```xml
<project>
    [...]
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.0.0</version>
                <configuration>
                    <includes>
                        <include>Sample.java</include>
                    </includes>
                    <excludes>
                        <exclude>**/TestCircle.java</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/TestSquare.java</exclude>
                    </excludes>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    [...]
</project>
```

Use `mvn test --fail-never` so that the testing continues even if certain test cases fail.

Running all tests may take a long time. Sometimes you may want to run only a few interesting test classes or test methods. In that case, you could run:

```bash
mvn -Dtest=TestCss test

mvn -Dtest=TestCss,TestImageUtil test

mvn -Dtest=TestEncryptUtil#encryptStreamTest+decryptStreamTest test
```

You may also use `-pl` to specify a module to run tests:

```bash
mvn test -pl docs-core
```

See here for detailed syntax on running single test.

## Checking Test Report

If you want to get easy access to test report, run `mvn surefire-report:report` which generates report in html format in `target/site/surefire-report.html` for each module. Note that **you have to execute tests first before you could generate report.**

You could open the report in a browser for examination.

### Surefire Report

#### Summary
| Tests | Errors | Failures | Skipped | Success Rate | Time |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 16 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 81.25% | 20.078 |

*(Note: failures are anticipated and checked for with assertions while errors are unanticipated.)*

## Test Coverage

Code coverage is a software metric used to measure how many parts of our code are executed during automated tests. In this tutorial, we'll use JaCoCo, a free code coverage reports generator for Java projects, to check the test coverage of Teedy.

First, add the following into the `pom.xml` of Teedy (you might want to manually reload the project to reflect the change):

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
    <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.9</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <!-- attached to Maven test phase -->
        <execution>
            <id>report</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>report</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

Then, run `mvn test jacoco:report -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true`. Again, you need to run tests first in order to generate reports. `-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true` will ignore any failures occurred during test execution.

This will generate a coverage report at `target/site/jacoco/index.html` within each module. Open the report in a browser to navigate and observe the results.

JaCoCo mainly provides three important metrics:

* **Lines coverage** reflects the amount of code that has been exercised based on the number of Java byte code instructions called by the tests.
* **Branches coverage** shows the percent of exercised branches in the code, typically related to if/else and switch statements.
* **Cyclomatic complexity** reflects the complexity of code by giving the number of paths needed to cover all the possible paths in a code through linear combination. This includes not only the conditional branches but also other control structures like loops and try-catch blocks.

Click any element to observe detailed code coverage.

JaCoCo reports help us visually analyze code coverage by using diamonds with colors for branches, and background colors for lines:

* **Red diamond** means that no branches have been exercised during the test phase.
* **Yellow diamond** shows that the code is partially covered – some branches have not been exercised.
* **Green diamond** means that all branches have been exercised during the test.

The same color code applies to the background color, but for lines coverage.

## Integrate Test Reports in Site Documentation

Finally, we may want to add test reports in our site documentation. Add the following in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<reporting>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-report-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.0</version>
            <reportSets>
                <reportSet>
                    <id>aggregate</id>
                    <inherited>false</inherited>
                    <reports>
                        <report>report</report>
                    </reports>
                    <configuration>
                        <aggregate>true</aggregate>
                    </configuration>
                </reportSet>
            </reportSets>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
            <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.8.9</version>
            <reportSets>
                <reportSet>
                    <id>aggregate</id>
                    <inherited>false</inherited>
                    <reports>
                        <report>report-aggregate</report>
                    </reports>
                </reportSet>
            </reportSets>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</reporting>
```

Then run: `mvn clean test site -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true`. Open `target/site/index.html` in your browser. Now, you could navigate the site doc to explore the surefire and JaCoCo reports easily.
